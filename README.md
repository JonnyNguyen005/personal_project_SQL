# Analyzing Students’ Mental Health in SQL
Can attending a university in a foreign country impact one’s mental well-being? In 2018, a Japanese university with a diverse student body conducted a comprehensive survey. An ethically and regulatory approved study based on this research was published the subsequent year.

The study’s findings revealed that students from different countries are more susceptible to mental health challenges than the general population. Specifically, predictive factors for experiencing depressive symptoms were identified as a student’s sense of social belongingness within a group and the stress linked to adapting to a new cultural environment.

Exploring student data using PostgreSQL was undertaken to delve further into this matter. The objective was to ascertain whether a comparable conclusion could be drawn concerning international students and whether the duration of their stay plays a role in these observations.

Below, you will find a description of the columns in the dataset that could be helpful in this investigation.
